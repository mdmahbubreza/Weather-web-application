# Weather-web-application
A digital platform designed to provide users with real-time weather information for specific locations, this application utilizes data from various meteorological sources and presents it in a user-friendly interface, offering a range of features to enhance the user's understanding of current weather conditions.


# The provided HTML code represents the structure of a weather web application. Here's a description of the key elements in the code:
1. **Document Type Declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`):**
   - This declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML being used, which is HTML5 in this case.

2. **HTML Structure:**
   - The HTML document is structured with `<html>` as the root element and includes a language attribute for English (`lang="en"`).
   - The `<head>` section contains meta tags for character set and viewport settings, as well as the title of the web page.
   - The `<link>` tag references an external stylesheet (`style.css`) for styling the content.

3. **Body Content:**
   - The content of the web page is within the `<body>` tag.
   - The content is organized within a `<div>` element with the class "container."

4. **Card Structure:**
   - Within the container, there are two main card elements (`<div class="card">` and `<div class="card2">`), each representing a distinct section of the weather information display.

5. **Search and Location Buttons:**
   - The first card includes a search bar (`<input type="text" id="city-input" />`) for entering city names and search and location buttons.

6. **Weather Information Display:**
   - The weather information is organized within a `<div class="weather-info">` element.
   - It includes a header with a weather icon, city name, country, temperature, and a date-time section for displaying the current time, day, and date.

7. **Day and Date Display:**
   - The day and date are displayed within a nested `<div class="day-date">` element, allowing for the simultaneous presentation of the day and date on the same line.

8. **Weather Details Card:**
   - The second card (`<div class="card2">`) contains an image (e.g., loading icon) and a section for displaying specific weather details, such as humidity, visibility, pressure, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset.

9. **JavaScript Integration:**
   - The HTML file references an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) for handling functionality such as fetching weather data, updating the time and date, and responding to user interactions.

In summary, this HTML code sets the foundation for a weather web application with a clean and organized structure, incorporating elements for user interaction, weather data display, and visual aesthetics. The associated CSS and JavaScript files (not provided here) would likely contribute to styling and dynamic functionality.


# The provided JavaScript code serves as the logic behind a weather web application. Let's break down the key components and functionalities:

1. **API Key and API URL:**
   - `apiKey`: Represents the API key for accessing OpenWeatherMap data.
   - `apiUrl`: Holds the base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API, specifying the desired units as metric.

2. **DOM Elements:**
   - Various `const` declarations are used to store references to HTML elements by their respective IDs (e.g., city input, search button, weather details, etc.).

3. **`fetchWeatherData` Function:**
   - An asynchronous function (`fetchWeatherData`) is defined to fetch weather data for a specified city.
   - It uses the `fetch` API to make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieves the response in JSON format.
   - If the response code is 200 (OK), it updates the displayed information on the web page with the fetched weather data, including city name, temperature, humidity, visibility, pressure, wind speed, country, sunrise, and sunset. It also displays the weather icon.
   - If the response code indicates an error, it throws an error and logs an error message.

4. **Event Listeners:**
   - Event listeners are set up for the search button and "Your Location" button.
   - When the search button is clicked, it calls the `fetchWeatherData` function with the city input value and displays the weather details while hiding the starting image.
   - The "Your Location" button, when clicked, attempts to retrieve the user's geolocation coordinates and fetches weather data for that location.

5. **Geolocation Handling:**
   - The script checks if the browser supports geolocation. If supported, it retrieves the user's current position and fetches weather data for that location.
   - If geolocation is not supported, an alert is displayed.

6. **Updating Time and Date:**
   - The script includes a `setInterval` function that updates the current time, day, and date every second. This information is displayed on the web page in real-time.

7. **Console Logging and Error Handling:**
   - The fetched weather data is logged to the console for debugging purposes.
   - Errors during the fetch operation are caught, and relevant error messages are logged to the console. Additionally, an alert is displayed to the user in case of an error.

In summary, this JavaScript code integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display real-time weather data based on user input or geolocation. It also handles user interactions, such as searching for a specific city and using the "Your Location" feature, while keeping the displayed time, day, and date up-to-date. Error handling ensures a robust user experience by providing feedback in case of issues.


# The provided CSS code is part of the styling for a weather web application, contributing to its visual appearance and layout. Here's a detailed description of the code:

1. **Universal Styling (`*` Selector):**
   - Resets margin and padding for all elements to zero.
   - Specifies the font family as "Poppins" and sets the box-sizing property to "border-box" to include padding and border in the element's total width and height.

2. **Body Styling (`body` Selector):**
   - Sets the background gradient for the entire body using a linear gradient from #6699ff to #dda0dd.
   - The background gradient creates a visually appealing backdrop for the weather application.

3. **Card Styling (`card` and `card2` Selectors):**
   - Defines the styling for the main cards used in the application.
   - Specifies the height, width, maximum width, background color with transparency, text color, margin, border-radius, padding, and positioning.
   - The cards are visually enhanced with background gradients or colors, rounded corners, and padding for content.

4. **Search Bar and Button Styling (`search` Selector):**
   - Styles the search bar and button by defining their widths, display properties, alignment, and background colors.
   - Uses flexbox for better layout control.

5. **Weather Icon Styling (`weather-icon` and `#weather-icon` Selectors):**
   - Positions the weather icon absolutely within the card and sets its width.
   - Adjusts the appearance of the weather icon to fit the design.

6. **Your Location Button Styling (`your-location` and `#your-location-button` Selectors):**
   - Styles the "Your Location" button, including its width, height, background color, border radius, and padding.
   - Positions the button within the card, providing a visual cue for users to access location-based weather information.

7. **Weather Details Styling (`weather-details` Selector):**
   - Defines the styling for the container of weather details, including flex properties for alignment and spacing.

8. **Additional Styling for Specific Elements (`#Starting-img`, `.container`, `.name`, `.date-time`, `.day-date`, `#current-date`, `#temperature`, `.weather-data p`):**
   - Styles specific elements within the application, such as the starting image, container, name, date-time, day-date, current date, temperature, and weather data paragraphs.
   - Uses positioning, margins, padding, font size, and border properties to achieve the desired layout and appearance.

9. **Responsive Design and Layout (`@media` Query - not included):**
   - The provided code does not include media queries, but a responsive design can be achieved by adding media queries to adjust styling based on different screen sizes.

In summary, the CSS code defines the visual presentation of a weather web application, incorporating a clean and modern design with careful attention to layout, color, and positioning. The styles contribute to a user-friendly interface, making the weather information easily accessible and visually appealing.
